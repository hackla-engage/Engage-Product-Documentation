# Getting-Started-With-Engage

Welcome to **Engage**!

The best way to get oriented is to head over to the [Engage Wiki](https://github.com/hackla-engage/Getting-Started-With-Engage/wiki), where you'll find information on product scope, wireframes, changelogs, and lots more.

You can also check out [the current Engage prototype](https://engage-santa-monica.herokuapp.com/#/).

Finally, if you're ready to jump into the Slack conversation, join [the Hack for LA Workspace](https://hackforla-slack.herokuapp.com/) and find us in the **#engage** and **#engage-dev** channels.

Thanks!
